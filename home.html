          <h4>What makes a good tutor?</h4>
          <p>
            Subject knowledge is key, but being a great tutor is about explaining complex concepts in a clear, <br>
              engaging, and personalized way. A tutor might have advanced degrees in Computer Science, but <br>
              that doesn't necessarily mean they can break down coding or algorithms for beginners. Our best <br>
              tutors not only explain tough topics but also help boost confidence, ensuring students unlock their <br>
              full potential in just a few lessons. <br><br>

              We carefully select our tutors, focusing on their knowledge and how relatable they are to students. <br>
              Each tutor is thoroughly interviewed, and only the most personable and skilled make it onto our <br>
              platform—just 1 in 8 applicants are chosen. <br><br>
